1. dpkg : default debian package management tool
    - installs oflline packages
    - `dpkg -i wireshak.deb` : will install package 'wireshak.deb' file in current directory
    - Installation includes two steps 'unpack' and configure
    - `dpkg --unpack wireshak.deb` : will unpack but not configure the package
    - `dpkg --configure wireshak` : will configure the unpacked wireshark package
    - `dpkg --remove` : remove/uninstall wireshark from system but retain config and user data files
    - `dpkg -P wireshak` : uninstall wireshak completely from the system including config and user data files
    - Querying package database:
        - Package Database for querying package info resides in '/var/lib/dpkg'
        - '/var/lib/dpkg/info' : package configuration scripts
        - '/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list' : list of files installed
        - '/var/lib/dpkg/status' : status of each installed package
        - `dpkg -L packagename` : lists the files that were installed by the specified package
        - `dpkg --search filename` : finds any packages containing the file or path passed in the argument
        - `dpkg --status package` : displays the headers of an installed package
        - `dpkg --list` : list of packages known to the system and their installation status
        - `dpkg --contents file.deb` : lists all the files in given 'file.deb' file
        - `dpkg --info file.deb`: displays the headers of the given 'file.deb' fil
    - '/var/log/dpkg.log' : dpkg logs 
2. apt : Advanced Package tool which takes care of missing dependencies while installing a package
    - It doesn't require a package to be downloaded before installing.
    - 'apt upgdate' : Downloads the list of currently available packages
    - `apt install wireshark` : will install wireshak in the system.
    - It will install the necassary dependencies automatically
    - `apt -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install wireshark` : passing force-owerwrite argument from dpkg while installing via apt 
    - `apt upgrade`, `apt-get upgrade` : looks for installed packages that can be upgraded without removing any packages.
    - `apt full-upgrade` : For major upgrades
    - `apt remove wireshak` : remove/uninstall wireshak from system
    - `apt purge wireshak` : uninstall wireshak completely from the system including config and user data files
    - Querying package database:
        - '/var/lib/apt/lists/' : list of reference Packages files located on Debian mirrors
        - '/var/cache/apt/archives/' : cached copy of already downloaded packages
        - `apt-cache search keyword`, `apt search keyword` : keyword-based package search
        - `apt-cache show package`, `apt show package` : display the headers of the packageâ€™s available versions
        - `axi-cache search` : alternative to 'apt-cache search' command
3. Package : 
    - .deb file for debian 
    - binary package can be directly used for its designed purpose
    - source package has source code in it
    - Debian package contains metadata required to install remove or update a package
4. '/etc/apt/sources.list' : lists the different repositories (or sources) that publish Debian packages.
    - APT retrieves its packages from a repository listed in this file
    - Each active line contains the description of a source, made of three parts separated by spaces
    - Commented lines begin with a #character
    - Syntax : 'deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib'
        - 'deb' for binary packages and 'deb-src' for source packages (includes source code)
        - 'http://http.kali.org/kali' : base URL of the source
        - 'kali-rolling main non-free contrib' : This field depends on repository structure:
        - Debian and Kali use three sections to differentiate packages according to the licenses chosen by the authors of each work.
            - 'main' : contains all packages that fully comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines
            - 'non-free' : contains software that does not (entirely) conform to these principles but which can nevertheless be distributed without restrictions
            - 'contrib' : contributions, set of open source software that cannot function without some non-free elements.
        - repositories :
            - 'kali-rolling' : main repository for end-users
            - 'Kali-Dev' : space where Kali developers resolve dependency problems arising from the merge of the Kali-specific packages into Debian Testing
            - 'Kali-Bleeding-Edge' : contains packages automatically built out of the upstream Git
5. Adding new source list : 
    - Create a new file under '/etc/apt/sources.list.d' which contains the repository info
6. Mirrors : 
    - 'http.kali.org' in base url is a server running mirrorBrain which will redirect your HTTP requests to an official mirror close to you
    - to see where you are being redirected, run : `curl -sI http://http.kali.org/README`
    - If apt command faces any issue using a mirror, than mirrors from above file can be directly used in sources.list file
