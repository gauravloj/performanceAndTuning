1. MAC address is the physical or hardware address of any network interface card (NIC)
2. MAC address along with IP address is used to identify anyone over a connected network
3. MAC address is limited to internal system only.
4. Run `ifconfig` : Value of HWaddr is the MAC address
5. Sample MAC address looks like '08:23:00:28:72:46'. In this, first three values are reserved for the vender.
6. From the vendor, one can identify if there is any vulnerability exposed by that vendor
7. MAC address can be changed using macchanger:
    - `macchanger -s <NIC>` : Displays the MAC address of given NIC device
    - `macchanger -r <NIC>` : Set random MAC address to specified NIC

8. Running macchanger on boot to change MAC address everytime system boots
    - `crontab -e` : Opens crontab file for editing
    - At the end of this file, add this line `@reboot macchanger -r <NIC>`. Eg `@reboot macchanger -r eth0`
