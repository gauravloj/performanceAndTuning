2. `man command` : opens manual page for given 'command'
    - Sometimes names can collide. For example, the shell’s read command has the same name as the read system call.
      This is why manual pages are organized in the following numbered sections:
        1. Commands that can be executed from the command line
        2. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
        3. Library functions (provided by system libraries)
        4. Devices (on Unix-like systems, these are special files, usually placed in the /dev/ directory)
        5. Configuration files (formats and conventions)
        6. Games
        7. Sets of macros and standards
        8. System administration commands
        9. Kernel routines
    - `man 2 command` : specify which section of manual page to use for given 'command'. 
        - These numbers can be from 1-9 as mentioned above
        - `man command` : Fetches first available section of man page  for that command.
                Eg. `man shadow` will display `man 5 shadow` by default as 1-4 are not available
3. `apropos` : searches manual pages (or more specifically their short descriptions) for any keywords that you provide
    - Eg. `apropos "copy file"
4. konquerer or yelp for graphical documentation
5. pinfo for detailed info documentation
6. package specific documentation :
    - '/usr/share/doc/<package>/README*' file in a package
    - <package>-doc : For large documentation. Eg. perldoc
    - README.Debian : indicates all of the adaptations that were made to comply with the Debian Policy
    - Locating package website : 
        - `apt show <package>` : package’s meta-information. Search 'homepage' for official website
        - '/usr/share/doc/package/copyright' : Official url
