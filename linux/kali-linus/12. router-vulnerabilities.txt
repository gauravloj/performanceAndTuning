1. Two usefule websites:
    - nmap.org
    - exploit-db.com
2. Get IP address of the router to crack using aircrack/nmap or any method.
3. Once you have access to a router then
    - 192.168.1.1 is the router address.
    - Browser will open router settings for that IP
    - User needs to enter username and password before going to settings page.
    - Many times router provides its model name
    - Using that model name, search on 'exploit-db.com' for that brand of router for any vulnerability.
    - Exploit that vulnerability
    - This method of hacking is called banner grabbing
4. Sometimes rom-0 cofiguration file is available on router address 'http://192.168.1.1/rom-0'
    - download that file `wget http://192.168.1.1/rom-0`
    - Search internet for scripts to read above file 'rom-0 configuration decompressor'
    - Alternatively, use 'zte-rom-decompressor.py' from scripts folder
