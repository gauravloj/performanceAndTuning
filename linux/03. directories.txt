1. bin : Binary files. Most of the bash executable files are stored here
2. sbin : System Binary files. Most of the bash executable files related to system management are stored here
3. boot : Linux kernel and other files required for its early boot process
4. dev: All the hardware devices are stored as a file here. Eg. sda is storage drive
        - /dev/sda : represents disk drive
        - /dev/sda1 : represents partition
        - /dev/input/mouse0 : represents mouse
        - /dev/input/event0 : keyboards
        - /dev/snd/* : sound cards
        - /dev/ttyS* : serial ports
        - Each device is either block type or character type
        - Character type can be navigated using seek commands
        - Block type can be streamed but can not be navigated
        - run `ls -l /dev/` : first character is either 'b' for block type or 'c' for character type
        - device specific commands can be invoked using 'ioctl' command
5. etc : All the system wide configurations are stored here
        - /etc/profile : system wide file for environment variables
        - /etc/environment : variables not specific to command line are stored here
6. lib, lib32, lib64 : Libraries used to execute binaries from  bin/sbin folder
7. media, mnt : External mounted drives are found here. temporary mount point
8. opt: 
        - Optional folder where manually installed softwares from vendor are stored. Eg. VPN
        - Extra application provided by third parties
9. proc : 'sudo' files that contains info about the processes
10. root: Home folder for root users
11. run : 
        - temp files are stored here which are stored only in RAM. They will be removed when system restarts
        - volatile runtime data that does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS)
12. srv : 
        - Information about different services
        - data used by servers hosted on this system
13. sys : system folder. User can interact with system using the files stored in this folder
14. tmp: Files that needs to be stored temporary, are stored here. These files are created by different applications,
        hence they will be available even after system reboot
15. usr : user specific Application folder where only user who installs the application can control it.
        - this directory is further subdivided into bin, sbin, lib according to the same logic as in the root directory
        - /usr/share/ contains architecture-independent data
        - /usr/local/directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without 
          overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg).

16. var : 
        - Files and directory that are expected to grow in size.
        - variable data handled by daemons. This includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.
17. home : Personal folder for each user
        - Traditionally, application configuration files are often stored directly under home directory.
        - Eg. .vscode, .android etc
        - According to new XDG Base Directory Specification:
            - configuration files should be stored under ~/.config
            - cache files under ~/.cache
            - application data files under ~/.local
            - the email system sometimes stores incoming emails to ~/Mail/
