1. Proxychains along with tor can be used to anonymise not only internet traffic but network traffic as well
2. Proxychains enables the ability to route network traffic through different routing servers
3. Best option for proxy is SOCKS5. SOCK4 does not support IPv6 and UDP protocol
3. Edit '/etc/proxychains.conf'
    - uncommentt 'dynamic_chain'
    - comment 'strict_chain'
    - proxy list can be added at the end of file.
    - By default, tor proxy is added 'sock4 127.0.0.1 9050'
    - Add another entry for socks5 'socks5 127.0.0.1 9050'
4. Start tor service
    - `service tor status` : Check if tor is running
    - `service tor start` : Start the service if not already running
    - `service tor restart` : Restart the service if already running
5. Verify if the network traffic is anonymous
    - `proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com` : opens the browser 'firefox' and open 'www.duckduckgo.com'
    - It will open firefox with duckduckgo home page.
    - On the terminal, there will be multiple IP displayed,
    - Search 'check for dns leak' : Open the website to test dns leaks
    - Your current (proxied) IP will be displayed
6. Route network traffic using proxychains
    - `proxychains <command>` : Eg `proxychains nmap`
7. To set custom proxies
    - search 'free socks5 proxies'
    - It will give websites that provides proxy information
    - Select proxy from trusted country which won't provide your imfortion to anyone
    - Few of trusted countries are : Netherland, Russia, Germany
    - Select any number of 'IP' along with it's 'port' and 'version'
    - Edit '/etc/proxychains.conf'
    - At the end of file, proxylist is given, add the selected proxies at the end of this file
    - Syntax to add a new proxy is : 'version IP port' . Eg. socks5 192.168.22.37 9889

8. Verify if custom proxy works. Same as step 5
